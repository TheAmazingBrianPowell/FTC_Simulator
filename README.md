# FTC Simulator
 A simple simulator for learning how to program FTC robots
 Note: This is not an accurate way of displaying exactly how a real robot will work, it should only be used to learn the drive system.

 Note: This is the first release of this project. It is not anywhere near complete, and there is still a lot to do. I am open to any suggustions.

## Setup instructions
1. Download the project
2. Find the file named MyOpMode.java this is where you will place your code
3. Compile the code: Run `javac path/to/FTC-simulator-master/FirstTechSimulator.java` in a command line tool
4. Run the code: Run: `java path/to/FTC-simulator-master/FirstTechSimulator` (with out .java)

## Updating your code
1. Save MyOpMode.java
2. Run: `javac path/to/FTC-simulator-master/MyOpMode.java`
3. Run the code: `java path/to/FTC-simulator-master/FirstTechSimulator`

## Updates
This is not the final product of this experiment. After school reopens, I plan on measuring some more variables to make this simulation more life-like as well as adding collisions, game components, and more functionality.
