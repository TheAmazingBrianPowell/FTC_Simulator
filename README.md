# FTC Simulator
 A simple simulator for learning how to program FTC robots
 
Note: This is not an accurate way of displaying exactly how a real robot will work, it should only be used to learn the drive system.

Note: This is the first release of this project. It is not anywhere near complete, and there is still a lot to do. I am open to any suggustions.

## Setup instructions
### Install Java
1. Go to https://www.java.com/en/download/ and install java
### Install the Simulator
1. Download the project and change the folder name to FTC_simulator
2. Double click on `FirstTechSimulator.class` to run or run it through a command line tool using `java bin/net/rhsrobotics/FirstTechSimulator`

## Updating your code
1. Click `Save Code`
2. Restart the program. Close the window and double click on `FirstTechSimulator.class`

## Updates
This is not the final product of this experiment. I plan on measuring some more variables to make this simulation more life-like as well as adding collisions, game components, and more functionality (such as driving with encoders).
